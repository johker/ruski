## RuSKI

Ruski is a simple, zero-dependency implementation of combinator calculus in Rust. 
It is based on the crate [lambda_calculus](https://github.com/ljedrz/lambda_calculus).

The terms are modeled in a graph which starts from a node representing the whole expression and breaks down into shared subexpressions.
